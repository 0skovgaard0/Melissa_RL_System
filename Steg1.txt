Welcome to the Melissa Project

Problem statement:
    Problem Statement:
The project's objective and ‘dream case scenario’ is to develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning model 
called Melissa that employs Boosting and Hybrid Neural Networks to predict top-performing investment portfolios.
Collecting and analyzing historical data, finding correlations and cross-correlations among different investment assets,
and implementing macroeconomic factors, Melissa aims to learn where to invest to generate a positive return on investments
that can handle various market conditions.

I write ‘dream case’ as it can be a complex project, which might change to a more simplified model if time starts to run out. 
Prediction certainty; with Monte Carlo Dropout integration, Melissa will be able to transparently inform us about how confident
she is in the investments. Ultimately letting her manage (fictional) money amount of $1,000,000 and her goal is
to create a portfolio that generates + 20% ROI.

Short Version:
We are developing an AI model called Melissa to predict the optimal investment portfolios for varying market conditions. 
It analyzes historical data and economic factors to make informed decisions. 
Displays the model's confidence in its predictions, with the goal of a 20% return on a fictional $1,000,000 portfolio.



Melissa the solution:
Melissa as a smart investment advisor who's always learning and enhancing her knowledge. 
She starts by researching various investment options, like stocks, bonds, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. 
She then examines their past performance to identify patterns, trends, and connections between assets.

Melissa also considers broader economic factors, such as GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and unemployment rates, 
to understand how they affect the performance of each asset.

Next, Melissa practices making investment decisions by allocating funds across different assets 
while staying within the $1,000,000 budget. She learns from her successes and mistakes, refining her strategy 
and improving her decision-making abilities over time. To ensure her predictions are accurate, 
she uses advanced techniques, such as Boosting algorithms.
Melissa also calculates the uncertainty or risk associated with each investment decision, 
sharing this information with users so they can make informed choices.

As market conditions change and new data becomes available, 
Melissa adapts her strategies to continue providing the best possible investment advice. 
In this way, Melissa acts like a personal investment advisor who's always learning, adapting, 
and striving to make the most informed decisions for her clients.




How Melissa Thinks:
1. Melissa's decision-making process for improved accuracy in asset allocation:
Identify asset classes and investment options: Melissa identifies various asset classes.
	Financiel data:
        Stocks
        Bonds
        EFTs for Bonds
        Individual Commodities
        REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)
        International Indices
        Crypto 

    Macroeconomy factors:
        GDP for 10 countries (Current in $ and annual growth in %)
        Bank Interest Rates
        Employment & Unemployment Rates


2. Feature extraction and analysis.
3. Incorporate macroeconomic factors.
4. Reinforcement learning and portfolio optimization.
5. Boosting algorithm for improved accuracy.
6. Uncertainty estimation (Monte Carlo Dropout).
7. Continuous improvement and adaptation.

Data quality & liability:
Data sources includes:
* Yahoo Finance (Stocks and other assets)
* World Bank (GDP, Bank Interest Rates, Employment & Unemployment Rates)
* FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) (Bonds)
* ECB (European Central Bank) (Euro to USD exchange rate)

I rely on every of the above data sources. Big organisations that have a lot of experience in collecting, 
providing and updating data.

We use about 20 datasets, some goes back to 1971 and some only to 2018.
ex. the 'bnk_int_rate.py' has: Total rows: 26519, Total columns: 7


Lär känna ditt data.  
• Är det komplett? 
For its usage, yes. Some datasets have historical data back from 1971 and others only from 2018. 
Most important I’ve tried to include a diversified and basic set that I believe will be able to find
crosscorrelation and correlation between different assets.

• Har du null-värden? 
Yes ‘Null-värden’ exists, especially on the weekends when the financial market is on a break/pause. 
Through the weekends I will let the asset keep the same value as it closed with on Friday (market close). 

• Har du extrema värden? 
The datasets don’t contain extreme outliers, if you look at them historically. 
Of course, the 2000s dot-com boom, 9/11, 2008 regression, covid have would be in the category of ‘extreme värden’
at the point when it happens. The bigger picture in hindsight where we see the different financial assets outliers
also affect some macroeconomic factors. 

• Vilka datatyper har datat? 
Datatypes is mostly: int, floats and objects. In other words, numbers and names.

• Vilka fält i ditt data vill du använda dig av? 
The financial assets I will use are the asset opening-, closing price, and trading volume, 
and see if I can find any trends connected with the macro factors.

• Hur kan du konvertera alla fält du vill använda till ett numeriskt format? 
Almost all data is numeric, whereas names of the asset, or country is an object 
and can be converted into a number if needed. 




















Project Description:
The Melissa Project aims to develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model that combines Boosting and Hybrid Neural Networks
to analyze and predict high-performing investment portfolios. By examining historical time-series data from
various investment assets and incorporating macroeconomic indicators, Melissa identifies correlations and cross-correlations
that inform strategic asset allocation decisions. The model's primary goal is to adapt to diverse market conditions, 
consistently generating robust returns on financial investments.

Melissa utilizes a Hybrid Neural Network that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for time-series data feature extraction
and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing long-term dependencies. 
This base model output is then integrated with a Boosting algorithm, such as AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting, 
to enhance its predictive accuracy.

We will evaluate Melissa's performance by simulating its investment returns across various periods, 
focusing on a wide range of investment assets and incorporating macroeconomic factors, like GDP growth, 
inflation, interest rates, and unemployment rates, to strengthen its ability to recognize trends and react 
to changing market conditions.
